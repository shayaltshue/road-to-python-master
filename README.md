# Road to Python Master

## Goal 
Document how and what I did to attempt to achieve the title of "Python Master". Note: This will likely change to reflect studying for a certification, rather than a vague title with no merits.

## Sections of this Project:

### Python Basics
* Data Structures
* Loops
* Comprehensions

### Object Oriented Programming

### Decorators

### Generators

### Meta Classes

### Context Managers
